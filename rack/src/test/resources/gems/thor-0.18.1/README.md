Thor
====

Description
-----------
Thor is a simple and efficient tool for building self-documenting command line
utilities.  It removes the pain of parsing command line options, writing
"USAGE:" banners, and can also be used as an alternative to the [Rake][rake]
build tool.  The syntax is Rake-like, so it should be familiar to most Rake
users.

[rake]: https://github.com/jimweirich/rake

Installation
------------
    gem install thor

Usage and documentation
-----------------------
Please see the [wiki][] for basic usage and other documentation on using Thor. You can also checkout the [official homepage][homepage].
